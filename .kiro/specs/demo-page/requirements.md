# Demo Page Requirements

## Introduction

This feature adds a dedicated demo page to the GenAI Conversation Viewer web application. The demo page will showcase the application's functionality by pre-loading an example conversation file, allowing visitors to explore the tool's capabilities without needing to upload their own conversation data.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user is on the demo page THEN the system SHALL provide navigation back to the main upload page
3. WHEN the demo page is accessed THEN the system SHALL load quickly without requiring file upload
4. WHEN sharing the demo URL THEN the system SHALL work consistently for all users

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user exploring the demo, I want to see all the features working with realistic data, so that I can evaluate the tool's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the demo conversation THEN the system SHALL display all message types (User, Tool Use, AI Response, Tool Results)
2. WHEN viewing the demo summary THEN the system SHALL show statistics and tool usage analytics
3. WHEN viewing the demo tools THEN the system SHALL display available tools with their specifications
4. WHEN clicking on tools in the summary THEN the system SHALL navigate to the tools tab and highlight the selected tool

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a site maintainer, I want the demo data to be properly organized and maintainable, so that it can be easily updated or replaced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN the system SHALL include the demo conversation data as a static asset
2. WHEN the demo conversation needs updating THEN the system SHALL allow easy replacement of the demo data file
3. WHEN the demo page loads THEN the system SHALL handle the demo data with the same validation as uploaded files
4. WHEN the demo data is invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
